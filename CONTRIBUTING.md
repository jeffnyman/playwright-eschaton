# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

This project has no intrinsic application code and therefore needs no entry point. This means that `"main": "index.js"`, has been removed from the `package.json`. All execution is based on the test runners that the project supports.

Welcome contributions are:

- bug fixes
- additional tests to the existing test references
- addiontal test references
- documentation improvements
- project structure improvements
